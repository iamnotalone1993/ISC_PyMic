Deep learning plays a vital role in a broad spectrum of scientific fields such as computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing and so on. In order to support deep learning, many frameworks are created with the aim of setting up artificial neural networks as quickly as possible. Such frameworks can be run on systems including either Graphical Processing Unit or Intel Xeon Phi the second generation - Knights Landing coprocessor. In addition, few deep learning frameworks can be run on legacy systems containing Intel Xeon Phi Knights Corner. For that reason, we propose and develop pyMIC2 which is a NumPy-like library supporting deep learning frameworks run on such legacy systems. pyMIC2 that is an extension of offloading module pyMIC implements basic functions so that it can be integrated easily into deep learning frameworks. The experimental findings show that pyMIC2 outperforms NumPy in terms of two hardware platform with the same theoretical performance. Moreover, pyMIC2 shows it is highly effective when integrating it into a well-known deep learning framework Chainer with very impressive performance. Hence, pyMIC2 is a fairly promising NumPy-like library to facilitate deep learning frameworks run on the legacy systems.
